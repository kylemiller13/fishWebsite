    <h2>Welcome to Cam's Aquariums!</h2>
    <p>I've been in the fish keeping hobby for nearly a year now. So far I have 3 stocked aquariums with one more aquarium on the way! I house aquatic plants, fish, and crustaceans in all of my aquariums. I've even had success breeding in them. Click the picture of the fish to learn more about their aquariums.</p>
